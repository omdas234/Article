    <p>Hello friend, my name is Rajendra and in this article, you will understand frontend development in good and easy language. Friends, frontend development is a part of web development. There are two types of jobs: frontend developer and backend developer. First you have to understand these two, after that your frontend development will be better understood.</p>
<p style="color:#FF0000;">_____________________________________</p>
    <h2>Difference of Frontend and Backend Development</h2>
    <p>I will help you understand this with an example. Friends, when you go to a shop to buy some product, you keep eating at the front of the shop. There you see the shop front and the shopkeeper. You ask him for things that you want. But does it happen that the shopkeeper immediately catches the things you asked for and gives them to you?</p>

    <p>No! All the things are stored in the back of the shop. The shopkeeper finds the product you have asked for from the store and then gives it to you. This entire process of going to the shop to ask for something and the shopkeeper bringing it to you, takes place in two parts of the shop: front and back. At the front you are looking for the items you want to eat, and at the back, you are looking for the items stored in the store. The same way this shop works, the same way the website also works.</p>
     
     <h2 style="color:#008080;">Shop Example</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Znw0dKsJ/IMG-20250129-123246.jpg" alt="Shop Example">
    </div>

    <p>Whenever you visit any website, whatever you see, all that information is in front of site . There is also a backend of the website, which works like a shop. This was the difference between frontend and backend which we understood from the example of a shop. </p>

<p style="color:#FF0000;">_____________________________________</p>

    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
    <p>Let us understand how frontend development works and how the frontend of a website is created.</p>

    <p>Friend, the entire website is made from code. The frontend of most of our sites is created using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will understand these 3 languages and will also see how they are used in the website:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</span> This is the body or complete structure of the website. The house you see in the example is just a structure. Without it, you will not be able to find a house like this. By the way, without HTML, the body of the website will not be created.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</span> By using CSS, we makeover the body created from HTML. That means we have done its complete design. Like earlier, the house was just a body, but after applying CSS, it got a complete design: color, door, and other things which make the house beautiful.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">JavaScript:</span> With its help, we can control the website. Now you see, a house will not be just a design. The door that we have should also work, it should have light, and all the things that make the house livable should work. JavaScript helps in doing all this work.</li>
    </ul>

     <h2 style="color: #008080 ;">House Example</h2>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

    <h2>Real Web Tool Example</h2>
    <p>The site in Example 1 above is a structure made up of only HTML. There is no design in it, nor will it work.</p>

    <p>Example 2 has been tightened, which makes it look good. But when you click on the button, nothing will happen, because it does not have JavaScript yet.</p>

    <p>JavaScript has been added in Example 3. See how the magnets (+ + or - -) move away from each other when you click the button. All this is done with the help of JavaScript.</p>
     
     
     <h2 style="color:#008080;">Example 1 and 2</h2>
    <div class="image-container">

     <h2 style="color:#008080;">Example 3</h2>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <p style="color:#FF0000;">_____________________________________</p>
    <h2>Backend Development</h2>
    <p>Programming languages like PHP, C++, Python are used in the backend.</p>

    <h2>The Right Way to Learn Web Development</h2>
    <p>Many people make the mistake that they read different languages. This should not be done. If you want to learn web development, you should do a specific course in which these languages are taught.</p>

    <p>Why do this? Because if you learn them separately, you will learn many things which are not necessary in web development, because these languages are not only used in web development, but are also very useful. So if you learn web development, we will also teach you these three languages, but each one is used in creating a website.</p>

    <p>So this friend who told you in frontend development. If you have any questions about the difference between frontend and backend and which language is used in frontend and what is the use of these languages, I also explained this in easy language with one example.</p>
    <p style="color:#FF0000;">_____________________________________</p>
    <p>I hope that from this article, you have understood well about frontend development. Thank you!üôèüèº</p>
